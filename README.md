# Mambo

Mambo is a business idea that a friend of mine has come up with and it needs a website.

It will be a hobbyist's football filming service based in Manchester, England. You sign up and pay a fee for one game to be recorded. Mambo sends down a camera operator who sets up a couple of static cameras and they operate a third camera to closely follow the action. Once the game is over the footage is prepared and edited to then be sent directly to the user within 24 hours.
