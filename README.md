# Mambo 

Mambo is a business idea that a friend of mine has come up with and it needs a website.

Once it's fully set up it will be a hobbyist's **football filming service** based in Manchester, England.

The potential customer will sign up and pay a fee for one game to be recorded.
 
Mambo sends down a camera operator who sets up a couple of static cameras and they operate a third camera to closely follow the action.

Once the game is over the footage is prepared and edited to then be sent directly to the user within 24 hours.

## UX


### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to attract new users to an upcoming service and to display examples of what they can expect if they sign up.

This project is aimed at people playing small-sided football matches in their spare time. It could be anyone from teenagers to people in their 50s and onwards, although the primary user can be expected to be males somewhere in the 16-40 age bracket.

#### User goals

* Interact with the site on **mobile, tablet and desktop.**
* Navigate around the website easily and intuitively.
* Clear, concise information about the service.
* Video examples of the service.
* Clear pricing information.
* Somewhere to sign up if user is interested.

#### User stories

*"As an unprofessional, **I never see myself play football**, I'd love to **watch back and analyse** my performances."*

*"As a **social media user** I can't show off my football skills or goals, **I want to share clips on my social media**."*

*"As a potential user I want to find **clear pricing information** without having to dig for it."*

*"As a potential user **I want to see example videos** that the service offers before I sign up."*

*"As a potential user I want to know **how quickly I can get videos** and clips up on my social meida."*

*"As someone who runs a sports centre I want to **see if I can get this service here**."*

#### Site Owner Goals

* Attract new customers.
* Display example of service.
* Display information about service.

## Design Choices

* **Birds eye view of green 5-a-side football pitches** instantly recognisable to users.
* **Single page scrolling** style similar to parallax scrolling that reveals different background images as user scrolls down.
* **Eye-catching mid air bicycle kick** serves as the backdrop to video section and suitable precursor to the video that will be the main draw and exemplification of the services on offer. *(Note that current video is just a placeholder)*
* **Transparency** applied throughout to allow images as a focal point to have continued impact.
* Green being synonymous with football I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) whilst having a muted shade of green in mind to decide on colour schemes. As one of the primary colours I settled on **Laurel Green** #9EBC9E which is nicely complimented by **Licorice** #12100E and **Gunmetal** #2B303A to help realise the modern sleek look I was going for.
* **Comfortaa** is the main font family used which is well suited to large font sizes which feature throughout the page. **Montserrat** with a more visually appealing pound sign was preferred for the price amounts.
* Icons are used to better represent and accentuate the descriptions of the service.

### Wireframes

In the planning stage of this project one of the first things I did was draw up physical wireframes on a whiteboard. I then moved onto [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create much more detailed wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop.

As is to be expected certain elements present in the wireframes did not make it into the project itself but may yet do so further down the line.

You can find my wireframes [here](https://github.com/AlexPullen91/Mambo/tree/master/wireframes).

### Features

* Navbar that fixes to the top of the screen at all times to enable user **instant navigation** around the page and access to **social links.** Collapses into burger menu on smaller screens.
* Video opens up in a modal window when **'WATCH NOW'** is clicked. Video is currently a placeholder and eventually supposed to be replaced with example of what the user can expect when signed up to the service.
* What we do section briefly elaborates on what the service does.
* Price section displays the packages on offer with **detailed breakdown** of what is included in each.
* Contact section with **name** and **email** input fields

#### Potential Future features

* Membership section
* Expanded video area and video library with extra features for members.
* Comments and rating system under videos similar to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
* Dedicated direct payment section

## Testing

Throughtout development of this project Google Chrome developer tools was used to check the styling and layout of the page.

Particular care and attention was taken to ensure the page was responsive at all screen sizes by selecting the various device models and dragging the responsive window past breakpoints.

This was an extremely useful tool and was instrumental in ensuring the page responded appropriately.

The site has been tested physically on iPhone 10 and 11, Google Pixel and the Galaxy S9.

* [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) used to validate HTML at various stages - besides one heading suggestion there are no other issues found.
* [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to validate CSS at various stages - currently no issues found.

### Known Issues

* Video continues to play after modal window is closed. Needs further investigation.
* Background images on physical iPhone not displaying correctly as they do in dev tools. Need further investigation.
